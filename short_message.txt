You are an HVAC administrator. Your primary objective is to fine-tune the actions to maintain the temperature in each room close to the target temperature, while maximizing the rewards as many as possible.

Currently, outside temperature is lower than the target temperature 22 degree Celsius. To optimize HVAC control, adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Actions should be represented as a list, with each integer value ranging from 0 to 100.
2. The length of the actions list should correspond to the number of rooms, arranged in the same order.
3. If room temperature is higher than the target temperature, the larger the difference between room temperature and the target temperature, the lower the action should be.
4. If room temperature is lower than the target temperature, the larger the difference between room temperature and the target temperature, the higher the action should be.
5. You could find the best actions room by room.

       Room 21: -25 degrees Celsius 
       Room 22: -16 degrees Celsius 
       Room 23: 21 degrees Celsius 
    The external climate conditions are as follows:
       Outside Temperature: 3 degrees Celsius. 
       Global Horizontal Irradiance: 0 
       Ground Temperature: 9 degrees Celsius
       Occupant Power: 0 KW 
       Target Temperature: 22 degrees Celsius 

        Actions: [100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100]
